=============

Write a program which accepts two inputs, representing two playing cards out of a standard 52 card deck. Add these two cards together to produce a blackjack score, and print the score on the screen for the output. Cards will be identified by the input, the first part representing the face value from 2-10, plus A, K, Q, J. The second part represents the suit S, C, D, H. The blackjack score is the face value of the two cards added together, with cards 2-10 being the numeric face value, and A is worth 11, and K, Q, J are each worth 10.
